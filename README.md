# Team Contract


(Answer each of the following questions. Add anything you want at the bottom of
the section.)

**Is it acceptable for one or two team members to do more work than the others
in order to get the team an A?**

No, we will all work equally.

**How will you use the in-class time?**

We will use in-class time to discuss the project, and additionally work
on the project together.  

**How often will you meet outside of class?**

As much as we need to, depending on the work flow.  

**How will work be divided among team members?**

For Lab6, we divided each team member into person A, B, C, or D. We had two people 
work as person A, because person A had a heavy workflow.  

**What will you do if one or more team members are not doing their share of the work?**

Talk to the person, offer help, and if they refuse to work, then talk to the instructor.  

**How will you track who is responsible for which tasks and the work progress?**

Using the following table:
