# Lab 6 Description

Please write a brief description here.

# Team Contract

(Answer each of the following questions. Add anything you want at the bottom of
the section.)

**Is it acceptable for one or two team members to do more work than the others
in order to get the team an A?**

Answer: No.

**How will you use the in-class time?**

Example answer: We will spend most of our in-class time discussing work
assignment and keeping track of the progress.

Answer: Review the lab packet.

**How often will you meet outside of class?**

Answer: As much as needed.

**How will work be divided among team members?**

Example answer: First we will divide the work load into a few pieces, e.g 4-8
pieces. We will rate each task with a score between 1 and 5. For example, we
divide the lab into 5 smaller tasks with score 1,1,4,5,10. Then each of us four
will do around 5 points. We roll a dice to determine who to pick first.  The
result could be that one picks the first 3 tasks, the second picks the
5-pointer and the rest two work on the 10-pointer together.

(Besides coding, tasks include printing the code and the sheets, etc.)

Answer: Go with the flow type of thing.

**What will you do if one or more team members are not doing their share of the work?**

Example answer: We are aware of the difference in ability among the team
members. While picking the tasks (according to the answer for the above
question), some member can consider take less work. As long as everybody keeps
positive and constant communication with the whole team, changes can be
adopted. However, if a member cannot make the deadline and does not communicate
with the team, a majority vote can be held to determine whether and how much
partial grade the member should receive for the particular lab in progress. For
example, this member may only receive 75% of the grades the team get for this
lab.

(Such decisions must be reported to the instructor in written form. The member
receiving the penalty may switch to another team at the instructor's discretion
after the certain lab is finished.)

Answer: Ask them to work more. 

**How will you track who is responsible for which tasks and the work progress?**

Example answer: Using the following table

| Task | Assignee | Deadline | Progress (date) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Game User Interface | Joel Gingrich & Chase Banyai | 11/13 ~ 11/20 | 0% as of 10/30/19 |
| Turn & Movement | Andrew Januszko | 11/13 ~ 11/20 | 0% as of 10/30/19 |
| Invoker (Builder & UI) | Morgan Williams | 11/13 ~ 11/20 | 0% as of 10/30/19 |
| Commands | Isabella Boone | 11/13 ~ 11/20 | 0% as of 10/30/19 |
